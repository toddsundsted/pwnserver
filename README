Installation
============

Pwnserver is pre-pre-Alpha software.  As such, it expects a lot from
its users.  This document should enable a user who is both technically
proficient and persistent to get pwnserver running.

Caveats
-------

 1) I've only tested this on Ubuntu 8.04 and CentOS 5.2.

Prerequisites
-------------

 1) A working installation of Ruby.
 2) A working installation of SQLite3.
 3) The sqlite3-ruby gem.

Installation Steps
------------------

Pwnserver expects the following directories to exist:

./db     contains the SQLite3 database
./data   contains the pwned data
./log    contains the logs

Create them.
